# Single Worm Database
First paper, re-analysis/re-organization of Yemini et. al. 2013
- almost ready:
	* webpage
	* upload to zenodo

# CeNDR + million mutations
GWAS study of the CeNDR and some of the million mutation strains
- collect CeNDR + probably another ~100 of the million mutation. 
	* Pryanka has two sets ready. It seems that it takes around 3-4 weeks per set. 
	I assume it could be speed up, but probably there is no need. There is still need of a third set + the expected forth set.
- how to analyze this data? CeNDR GWAS tool, we still need to talk with bioinformaticians. 
- define new features (see below)

# features paper
- A replacement to the original Yemini et al 2013 features
	* original features make a pretty decent job but they are messy...
	* subdivide into postural information and time-dynamics information.
- Plate-wise features.
	* food relate (food leaving, edging, orientation)
	* worm to worm interaction (cluster size, interaction time, interaction probability)
- This is probably tracker specific:
	- egg laying detection on plates (what is the biological relevant feature)?
	- ventral dorsal automatic identification
	- improve segmentation with u-net?

# Extras
Can we get more of the single worm data?
	-> egg laying. I can probably optimize the egg detection, and it would be a base (transfer learning) for the multiworm tracker.
	-> there is already very long videos of single worms. Are worms ergodic?
	-> Comparison old and new data. Is it useful, but it would be relevant? I have the original data we pick up we Pryanka and Adam.
(summer students projects)
Optogenetics - it could become a tool. Very manual analysis, i am not even sure it could be generalized. Each experiment type might require its own analysis.
laying eggs times - scientifically interseting but risky, but it might be a good test for new features.


#Â Helper
- Serena and Linus stuff.
	* Cluster size in dense populations.
	* Pharinx orientation into the tracker general pipeline.
- Adam's swimming videos.
	* Swimming is challenging by itself, it might require new algorithms,
- Finish to convert the stage correction into python.
- Can i create an anaconda installer for my package?
